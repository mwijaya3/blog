        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-8 col-md-10 mx-auto">
            <p>When I told people that my job title is a Data Scientist, they usually pause for a couple moments and ask what exactly is a Data Scientist?
            The simplest answer that I gave is Data Science is a combination of <strong>Math, Computer Science, and Engineering </strong>. For Math and Computer Science,
            usually we have a problem statement (what we would like to solve), then model the problem via algorithm typically for one of these classic problems whether it is a Classification task (eg. Predict if the picture is a cat or a dog, etc)
            or Regression task (Predict the sales of the store on a particular day based on hour, weather, location of store). Then, we implement the model using programming software such as Python and R.</p>

            <p>Now you must be thinking, what about the <strong>Engineering</strong> part?
                In order to solve problem, Data Scientist need to be knowledgeable on the subject that he/she is working on.
                For example: If you are working in a Supply Chain company, you must understand how Supply Chain works (terminologies and concepts).
                It will make you a better problem solver if you understand what you are working on.</p>

            <p>To reiterate, here are what it takes to be a Data Scientist:
            <ul>
              <li>Math</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Optimization (Foundation of Machine Learning is Optimization)</li>
                  <li>Proofing: This is vital if you want to know how Math formula is generated</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Computer Science</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Data cleaning</li>
                  <li>Visualization</li>
                  <li>Good coding practice</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Engineering: Approach the problem as if you are an Engineer (You will save a lot of time if you think through the problem before solving it)</li>
              <li>Curiosity to learn and always update yourself with new skill and novelty approach (algorithm, modeling technique, etc) to solve problems</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Where Do I Learn to Become a Data Scientist?</h2>

            <p>There are several path one can take to become a Data Scientist:
              <li>Go to University that has Analytics related degree or Computer Science with focus on Machine Learning </li>
              <li>Self-taught via MOOC (Massive Open Online Course): <a href="https://www.coursera.org/" target="_blank">Coursera</a>, <a href="https://www.edx.org/" target="_blank">edX</a> to name a few
            </p>

            <p>The most important part is <strong>PRACTICE, PRACTICE, AND MORE PRACTICE!</strong> This is very relevant especially on coding side of things.
              For someone who code regularly and take a month or two months break for vacation, he/she will forget a lot of syntax for that particular programming language after not coding for couple months.
              I highly recommend work on a lot of interesting problems on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. You can learn from the notebook (coding and algorithm approach) posted by other users.

            <h2 class="section-heading">What is/are My Favorite Programming Language?</h2>

            <!--

            <p>You must be rolling your eyes because there are 2 groups: R > Python and Python > R
               There are a lot of debates out there on which is better. My take on it is to use whichever language that you feel the most comfortable.
               I used both languages interchangeably because there are packages available in R but not in Python and vice versa. Also, I recommend everyone to learn <strong> SQL (Structured Query Language) </strong>
               because you will spend 60% of your time to pull the data that will be important for analysis as well as data cleaning.</p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">What is the Job Market Like?</h2>
          <p>Read this <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/data-science-and-analytics.html" target="_blank">article</a> written by PwC.
             The job market is hot and in high demand. However, it will become more competitive as the job market matures. According to PwC, US average annual salary for Data Scientist is $94,576.
             From my personal experience, most companies look for someone with a PhD degree or Masters degree with 3-5 years experience for Data Scientist position. However, there are companies that
             would omit that requirement if you have proven that you are capable.</p>
          </p>
          <h2 class="section-heading">Conclusion</h2>
          <p>In the end of the day, you have to pursue the job that will make you happy. I hope this small write up can help you to see what it takes to be a Data Scientist.
             It takes a lot of passion and hard work to be a good Data Scientist but it is quite satisfying if you can use data to come up with cool insight. Last but not least,
             remember this quote by <strong>W. Edwards Deming.</strong> <blockquote class="blockquote">In God we trust. All others must bring data.</blockquote>
